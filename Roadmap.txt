Layer 1 — Core Foundations
Objective: Basic working app. Install Python 3, Git, and VS Code or PyCharm.
Learn Python syntax, functions, data structures. Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript fundamentals.
Pick framework: Flask (lightweight) or Django (full-stack). Use SQLite for local database.
Version control: GitHub repo.
Deliverable: Local app that lets user add family members, relationships, and display them in a simple list.

Layer 2 — Data Modeling & API
Objective: Structured, queryable family catalog. Use SQLAlchemy or Django ORM for database interaction.
Create tables: People, Relationships, Notes, Documents. Implement REST API endpoints (CRUD for family data).
Add JS frontend calls to API. Deliverable: Local ancestry catalog with searchable, updatable records.

Layer 3 — Containerization
Objective: Make app portable. Learn Docker basics (images, containers, volumes, networks).
Dockerize app. Use Docker Compose for multi-service setup (app + DB).
Store secrets/configs in .env files.
Deliverable: App runs consistently inside Docker, independent of host system.

Layer 4 — Deployment & CI/CD
Objective: Automate delivery, deploy online. Learn GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
Set pipeline: build → test → deploy. Deploy app to hosting (Heroku, Render, AWS EC2, DigitalOcean).
Configure Nginx reverse proxy. Add HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt or managed TLS.
Deliverable: Publicly accessible ancestry website with auto-deployment from repo.

Layer 5 — Infrastructure as Code
Objective: Infra is reproducible. Learn Terraform: provision servers, networking, storage.
Optionally: Ansible for configuration mgmt. Use secrets manager for DB passwords and API keys.
Deliverable: Infra deployable in minutes via Terraform.

Layer 6 — Monitoring & Logging
Objective: Visibility into system. Add Prometheus for metrics. Build Grafana dashboards for site performance and DB queries.
Implement central logging (ELK or EFK stack). Deliverable: Metrics and logs accessible from dashboards with alerts configured.

Layer 7 — Scaling & Orchestration
Objective: Production-grade. Learn Kubernetes basics. Deploy app + DB to Kubernetes cluster.
Package with Helm. Configure load balancing and auto-scaling.
Deliverable: Ancestry site runs on scalable Kubernetes infra.

Layer 8 — Security & Reliability
Objective: Secure and resilient system. IAM: roles and permissions.
Secrets: Vault or cloud KMS. Automated DB backups and recovery. Vulnerability scans.
Deliverable: Secured site with backups, access controls, and recovery plans.

Layer 9 — Long-Term Extensions
Objective: Advanced features. Switch to Neo4j graph database for complex relationships.
Add genealogy API integrations. Implement user accounts and role-based access.
Build interactive family tree visualization with React or D3.js.
Deliverable: Full-featured ancestry platform with advanced visualization and external data integration.
